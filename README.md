# Planning Mixture of Experts
This repository contains PyTorch implementation of Planning Mixture of Experts (PMoE) for autonomous urban driving in CARLA simulator.

## Dependencies
This repo uses PyTorch and CARLA simulator (0.9.10.1). Please make sure that all dependencies are installed by running:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Please specify the CARLA root directory at the top of `run.sh` file.
```bash
export CARLA_ROOT=~/Projects/nazeri/CARLA_0.9.10.1          # change to where you installed CARLA
```
You need at least a middle range GPU to run the experiments with minimum possible batch size.

## Training
To run different training stages, please see [experiments doc](docs/experiments.md) first. You can define the 
training and model parameters via the respective config file 
in `conf` directory, then, use `run.sh stage_number` to run training where `stage_number` can be one of 
`stage0`, `stage1`, `stage2`, `stage3`. To see more options, and their description execute `./run.sh -h`

## Evaluation

To evaluate the models there are two options, Carla leaderboard evaluation or nocrash evaluation which can 
be run via `./run.sh benchmark` or `./run.sh nocrash` respectively. You can configure the model and benchmark 
parameters through the `conf/benchmark.yaml` config file.

## Dataset
The dataset was collect using [this repo](https://github.com/mhnazeri/carla_data_collector) which is fork of [LBC leaderboard submission](https://github.com/bradyz/2020_CARLA_challenge).
